This folder should contain exhibit images referenced by the level anchors.

Recommendations:
- Place images in this folder so they are served at runtime at paths like /exhibits/art_01.jpg
- Filenames should match the anchor ids used in your GLB anchors, e.g. an anchor named "ExhibitAnchor_art_01" should have an image "art_01.jpg" in this folder.
- Use optimized JPG/PNG files; consider providing both thumbnail_ and full_ versions for fast loading.

Example:
- public/exhibits/art_01.jpg
- public/exhibits/art_02.jpg
