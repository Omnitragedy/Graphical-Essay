 * TextTriggerMap
 *
 * Map of TextTrigger IDs -> display text. IDs correspond to the name suffix
 * you use in the GLB node name after the "TextTrigger" prefix.
 *
 * Example GLB node name: "TextTrigger_Intro" -> id = "_Intro" -> normalized to "Intro"
 *
 * Add entries here to control what text is shown for a trigger without embedding
 * the text in the GLB userData.
